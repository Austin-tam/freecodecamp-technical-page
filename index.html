              Python is an interpreted, object-oriented programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991,
              Python is one of the most popular choices for backend development, being employed by websites such as Instagram, Uber, Dropbox, and many more.
            </p>
            <p>The main feature of python is that it is made to be beginner friendly and easy to learn. Other features of the language include: </p>

            <ul>
              <li><b>Easy-to-read</b>: The simplistic syntax makes it easy and quick to read the code</li>
              <li><b>Easy-to-maintain</b>: Since the code is easy to read, it is therefore easy to maintain</li>
              <li><b>Portable</b>: Python can run on many different hardware platforms and shares the same interface across all of these platforms</li>
              <li><b>Large Standard Library</b>: Python has a large standard library which provides a set of many useful built-in modules and functions for a variety of uses</li>
            </ul>
          </article>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="syntax">
          <header>
            <h1>Syntax</h1>
          </header>

          <article class="tab">
            <p>
              The definition of syntax is "the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences in a language".
              We can apply this definition to programming languages as well. Syntax, in the context of a programming language,
              refers to the structure of the language, and the arrangement of words and phrases. Although Python was originally
              developed as a teaching language, its easy-to-use nature and clean syntax has appealed to beginners and experts as well.
              Python uses English words in places where other languages would use punctuation.
            </p>

            <p>For example, take the following Java code:</p>

            <div class="tab">
              <code>
                int[] values = new int[100];<br>
                for (int i=0; i&lt;values.length; i++) { }
              </code>
            </div><br>

            <p>Now compare it to the following Python code:</p>
            <div class="tab">
              <code>
                values = [0] * 10 <br>
                for i in range(0, len(values), 1):
              </code>
            </div><br>

            <p>
              As you can tell, the for loop declaration in Python is "easier" to read since it uses more English words and one can instinctively understand
              what is happening. Whereas with the Java code, one would have to look through each section of the for loop to understand each part.
            </p>

            <p>
              Another example is Python's use of <code>Not</code> in place of <code>!</code> that many other languages use. With a larger code base,
              finding and reading the keyword <code>Not</code> is easier than <code>!</code> which makes it harder to miss and harder to make errors.
            </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="variables">
          <header>
            <h1>Variables</h1>
          </header>

          <article class="tab">
            <p>
              In programming, variables are used to store data values. Python is a strongly and dynamically typed language. Strong meaning that the type
              of a value does not change in unexpected ways, and dynamic meaning that Python checks the types of values at runtime rather than at compile time.
              Because of this, variables in Python code are very easy to create and initialize.
            </p><br>

            <p>For example, a simple variable declaration can look like this:</p>

            <div class="tab">
              <code>
                x = 0
              </code>
            </div><br>

            <p>
              This tells Python to create an integer object with a value of 0 and have the variable "x" point to that object.
              Similarly, when you declare strings like this:
            </p>

            <div class="tab">
              <code>
                y = "text"
              </code>
            </div><br>

            <p>Python creates a string object with the value of "text" and has the variable "y" point to that object.</p>

            <p>
              Python has very little restrictions in terms of variable names. They can be any length and can consist of any combination of uppercase and
              lowercase letters (A-Z, a-z), digits (0-9), and the underscore character (_). The main restriction is that the first character of a variable
              name cannot be a digit. The only other restriction is that variable names in Python cannot be the same as any of the keywords that Python
              has reserved for special functions. These keywords include:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>False</li>
              <li>True</li>
              <li>if</li>
              <li>None</li>
              <li>not</li>
              <li>and</li>
              <li>def</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="main-section" id="control_flow">
          <header>
          <h1>Control Flow</h1>
          </header>

          <article class="tab">
            <p>
              Control flow, in programming, refers to the order in which statements, instructions, and/or function calls are executed. Control flow is
              important to know as most of the time there will be situations where the program will need to do different things based on different
              states. In other cases, the program may need to break the flow of the program to execute code multiple times. For cases like these,
              programmers use control flow statements to handle the flow of the program.
            </p>

            <p>These control flow statements include:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>The <code>if</code> statement</li>
              <li>The <code>For</code> loop</li>
              <li>The <code>while</code> statement</li>
              <li>The <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> statements</li>
            </ul>

            <p>There are many other control flow statements but these are the ones we will be focusing on in this section.</p>

            <p>
              The <code>if</code> statement is one of the most common control flow statements frequently used in programming. In Python, the full if
              statement looks like this:
            </p>

            <div class="tab">
              <code>if . . elif . . else</code>
            </div><br>

            <p>
              With this statement, the program will execute code if a logical condition is true. If false, the program will check the "elif",
              short for "else if", conditional statements and if true, will execute that code. If none of the conditional statements return true, it will
              execute the code in the "else" block. The conditional statements must evaluate to be true or false for the if statement to work properly, and
              there can be any number of elif statements. Python also does not have a <code>switch . . case</code> statement like many other
              languages use.
            </p><br>

            <p>
              Another commonly used control flow statement is the <code>for</code> loop. This statement is used to loop through a block of code, as long
              as the condition of the for loop is true. To create a for loop in Python, you would do something similar to this:
            </p>

            <div class="tab">
              <code>for . . in . . else</code>
            </div><br>

            <p>
              the <code>for</code> part of the statement starts the loop. Between the <code>for</code> and the <code>in</code> section is a variable
              that will be used to iterate through a range. This range is defined after the <code>in</code> portion of the loop. For example if the range
              is <code>range(0,5)</code> then the loop will iterate through the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, and execute the block of code for each of those
              numbers. The <code>else</code> portion of the for loop is optional. If the program breaks out of the loop or the loop is finished, the
              program will check for any code in an <code>else</code> block and execute it if it is there.
